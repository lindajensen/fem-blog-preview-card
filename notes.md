- Is the Learning-thing a button or no?

# Ideas to test myself

- The font sizes in this project a slightly smaller in the mobile layout. Find a way to reduce font size for smaller screens without using media queries -- use calc() -- https://code.pieces.app/blog/introduction-to-building-responsive-ui-with-css-calc 
# Things to remember

- Don't forget the favicon this time!
