## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about box-shadow, which was new to me. I mean I've seen it on webpages, but I've never tried it myself. So that was really cool.

I also learned about how to use an image as a pointer. I'm not sure that was how the challenge was suppose to be solved but it worked.

```css
a:hover {
    color: var(--primary);
    cursor: url('/assets/images/icons8-pointer-26.png'), auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to continue working with Flexbox and also margin and padding. I feel like I'm getting better and better at it, but I definitely need more practice. 

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18551277/using-external-images-for-css-custom-cursors) - This helped me with figuring out how to change the pointer when hovering over a link.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp) - This article helped me with the box-shadow property.
